My portfolio of projects I started to create in 2022.

## Goals
I eventually expect to have a github page listing all the projects I have created, and links to other projects I have worked on.

### Status:
~~I am currently taking about 3 online courses.~~ Make that 4 courses. I hope I don't get overwelmed. 
1. Free code camp
2. w3 schools
3. Upskillist Cybersecurity course.
4. Microsoft Learn

In freecodecamp (FCC) I'm learning about responsive web design and in w3schools (W3) I learned how to use git from the command line. Microsoft Learn (MSL) courses will be focused on Visual Studio and Powershell. I still haven't started the cybersecurity course.

Update: I completed W3's Git course, but I feel I need to learn even more. FCC has future courses coming up that involved Git, so I'm definitely looking forward to that. I think the next W3 course will be more congruent with what I'm learning in FCC like HTML and CSS. Maybe I'll learn something different.

"Never stop learning."
