# jds85.github.io
My portfolio of projects I started to create in 2022.

## Goals:
I eventually expect to have a github page listing all the projects I have created, and links to other projects I have worked on.

### Status:
I am currently taking about 3 online courses. I hope I don't get overwelmed. 
1. Free code camp
2. w3 schools
3. Upskillist Cybersecurity course.
