My portfolio of projects I started to create in 2022.

## Goals
I eventually expect to have a github page listing all the projects I have created, and links to other projects I have worked on.

### Status:
I am currently taking about 3 online courses. I hope I don't get overwelmed. 
1. Free code camp
2. w3 schools
3. Upskillist Cybersecurity course.

In freecodecamp I'm learning about responsive web design and in w3schools I'm learning how to use git from the command line. I still haven't started the cybersecurity course.

"Never stop learning."
