I didn‚Äôt know where to start so I signed up for Free Code Camp &amp; did 33 lessons of Responsive Web Design. I also signed up for GitHub &amp; created my first repo. Pushing beyond üíØ!!</p>&mdash; Jose D. Sanchez (@JDS_85) <a href="https://twitter.com/JDS_85/status/1559571058742665219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2022</a></blockquote>

I finally learned how to install git in windows powershell. Not sure, but this all feels like coding to me!</p>&mdash; Jose D.

I‚Äôve been studying git forever. Had a breakdown about my age and coding.üò≠ Years learning without earning! But the good people at the FCC discord reminded me: ‚Äúwe have immense value because we‚Äôve invested in ourselves. Don‚Äôt ever forget that.‚Äù</p>&mdash; Jose D.

Some what figured out how to use ssh in powershell. Learned that all command lines are not created equally. Still need to learn how to copy content to a clipboard from the powershell. <a href="https://t.co/2gueLmjl2k">https://t.co/2gueLmjl2k</a></p>&mdash; Jose D.

Comfortable with html, css and git. I signed up for Microsoft Learn because it‚Äôs time to stick to a code editor and so far Visual Studio seems to be it. So afraid of missing a day! Good for scheduling practice.</p>&mdash; Jose D. Sanchez (@JDS_85) <a href="https://twitter.com/JDS_85/status/1561194076032180227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2022</a></blockquote>

Decided to look around my pc today. Tried fixing missing icon images for two links on my desktop. Found a picture from 5 years and 5 months ago.

Vanilla notepad, vanilla console, vanilla browser. Microsoft Visual Studio kicked my butt. I some how broke my index.htm files trying to revert back to a previous state. Edge‚Äôs developer tools also look like VS now:(</p>&mdash; Jose D.
